      <p>
        Stucado started as a project for NUS&apos;s Orbital program, where we were tasked with creating any software
        project. As students ourselves, we wanted to create a tool that would help us and our peers study more
        effectively. We quickly realized that we had the opportunity to create something truly impactful.
