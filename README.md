## About
### Motivation
In today's fast-paced digital world, students face an array of challenges when it comes to managing their academic workload efficiently. With an ever-increasing list of tasks and responsibilities, the limited amount of time available often leads to stress and anxiety. The prevalence of social media and digital distractions only exacerbates these issues, making it easy for students to lose track of their priorities and fall into a cycle of procrastination. Furthermore, the pressure to excel academically adds to the burden, leaving many students feeling overwhelmed and unsure of where to begin.

Adding to the urgency of addressing these challenges is the concerning state of mental health among NUS students, as highlighted by recent news articles. The demands of academic life, coupled with the stressors of modern living, underscore the need for proactive solutions to support students in their academic journey while keeping them motivated.

While study apps are not uncommon, there remains a gap in the market for tools that provide personalized solutions to these issues. Despite the availability of many high-quality study apps, few effectively address the nuanced challenges faced by students in today's digital age.

This is where Stucado shines. As a data-driven productivity tool tailored to the needs of individual students, Stucado offers a unique solution to the challenges of time management and productivity.
### Vision
By collecting and analyzing user data, Stucado provides personalized messages and recommendations to help students optimize their study habits and maximize their productivity.

With features such as customized to-do lists, timetable integration, and adaptive pomodoro timers, Stucado empowers students to take control of their academic journey with confidence. By leveraging technology to offer actionable insights and support, Stucado not only helps students excel academically but also promotes overall well-being.
### Aim
Stucado aims to provide students a data-driven platform to optimize their daily productivity by constantly collecting data and tweaking its algorithm. Our goal is to transform the way students approach their studies by offering an intelligent, adaptive tool that not only helps them manage their time effectively but also enhances their overall learning experience.

We aim to alleviate the stress and anxiety associated with academic workload by providing a structured and supportive environment. By supercharging ordinary features such as timetables, to-do lists and pomodoro timers with the power of data, we aim to provide actionable insights and recommendations. This would help students make informed decisions about when and how to study, ensuring that they get the most out of their day. 

Stucado is designed to be a reliable companion for students throughout their academic journey. By keeping all user data stored locally and ensuring offline functionality, the app respects usersâ€™ privacy and provides uninterrupted support, regardless of internet connectivity. Our ultimate aim is to empower students to take control of their academic success with confidence, efficiency, and a sense of enjoyment.
